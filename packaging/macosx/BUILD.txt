How To build darktable.app from source in 6 easy steps ;): INTEL ONLY will try universal build later ;)

Installing:


1) install XCode DeveloperPackage from Apple
   install macports from macports.org make shure you have the latest version ( sudo port -v selfupdate )
	
	!!! default install is /opt/local/ change this below if you have different macport dir !!!


2) (Optional) add +quartz +atsui +no_x11 -x11 to /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf
   (There have been some problems with DT when using GTK Quartz; X11 seems to work better, at least on my machine)
   set "buildmakejobs" to more than 1 in /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf to use multiple threads 

3) run:
   sudo port -d sync
   sudo port install gtk2 sqlite3 libglade2 lcms exiv2 gtk2-clearlooks hicolor-icon-theme

	take a walk ! !

4) compile dt from git:

	git clone git://darktable.git.sf.net/gitroot/darktable/darktable
	cd darktable
	./autogen.sh
	LDFLAGS="-L/opt/local/lib -llcms" CC=gcc-4.2 CXX=g++-4.2 ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/release --disable-lensfun --enable-debug
	(Optional -- you don't need to enable debug, and if youhave compiled the lensfun package manually you don't need to disable it either)
	sudo make install

	if you don't want a bundle just type "darktable" in console now ;) !


Bundlecreation:


5) load ScriptExecCocoa/ScriptExec.xcodeproj with Xcode and click build

6) run: . bscript.sh

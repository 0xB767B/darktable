this is darktable, a free raw photo viewer and organiser.

to build it, you need:

 - lcms gtk+-2.0 libglade-2.0 libgthread-2.0 cairo libjpeg libpng gconf lensfun tiff exiv2

other used packages (supplied in the source tree):

 - LibRaw nikon_curve (taken from ufraw)

then, type:
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
# make install
$ darktable

(the first step is only necessary when building from git for the first time)
and enjoy!

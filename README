this is darktable, a free raw photo viewer and organiser.
darktable is not a lighttable.

to build it, you need:

 - lcms gtk+-2.0 libglade-2.0 libgthread-2.0 cairo libjpeg libpng gconf lensfun

other used packages (supplied in the source tree):

 - LibRaw nikon_curve (taken from ufraw)

then, type:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure [--enable-debug] --prefix=$(pwd)/install
 $ make install
 $ ./install/bin/darktable

(the first step is only necessary when building from git for the first time)
and enjoy!


speedhack:

 $ cp ~/.darktabledb /dev/shm
 $ echo -n "/dev/shm/.darktabledb" > ~/.darktablerc
 $ darktable
 $ cp /dev/shm/.darktabledb ~/
 :)

sizehack:

 $ sqlite3 ~/.darktabledb
 > delete from mipmaps;
 > delete from mipmap_timestamps;
 > vacuum;

 darktable will re-generate cached mipmaps in db on demand.

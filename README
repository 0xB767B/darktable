this is darktable, a free raw photo viewer and organiser.

to build it, you need:

 - lcms gtk+-2.0 libglade-2.0 libgthread-2.0 cairo libjpeg libpng gconf lensfun tiff exiv2

other used packages (supplied in the source tree):

 - LibRaw nikon_curve (taken from ufraw)

then, type:

 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ ./configure [--enable-debug] --prefix=/usr
 # make install
 $ darktable

(the first step is only necessary when building from git for the first time)
and enjoy!

this is darktable, a free raw photo viewer and organiser.
darktable is not a light table. it's digital.

to build it, you need:

 - lcms
 - gtk+-2.0
 - libglade-2.0
 - libgthread-2.0
 - cairo
 - MagickCore

other used packages (supplied in the source tree):

 - LibRaw
 - nikon_curve (taken from ufraw)

then, type:

 $ autoreconf --install
 $ ./configure [--enable-qwerty] [--enable-debug]
 $ make
 $ src/darkroom

(the first step is only necessary when building from svn for the first time)
and enjoy!

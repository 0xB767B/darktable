      <p><em>darktable is a photography workflow application: a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.</em></p>

<p>this project tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free raw converters and image management tools (such as e.g. ufraw, rawstudio, f-spot, digikam, shotwell). The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all stored in a database. the main focus is on user interaction, both in terms of a smooth interface design as well as processing speed. high quality output is also one of our goals.</p>

<p>all editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export.
raw image loading is done using libraw and rawspeed, high-dynamic range, and standard image formats such as jpeg are also supported.
the core operates completely on floating point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).</p>

      <p><em>darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers: it manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw images and enhance them.</em></p>

<p>this project tries to fill the gap between the many excellent existing free raw converters and image management tools (such as ufraw or f-spot). The user interface is built around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all stored in a database. the user will always be able to interact, even if the full resolution image is not yet loaded.</p>

<p>all editing is fully non-destructive and only operates on cached image buffers for display. the full image is only converted during export.
the frontend is written in gtk+/cairo, the database uses sqlite3, raw image loading is done using libraw, hdr, exr and low dynamic range are supported through imagemagick (magickcore).
the core operates completely on floating point values, so darktable can not only be used for photography but also for scientifically acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic range).</p>

      <em>(2009-10-23)</em> there have been some major internal changes in dt since 0.2, and
      some of them result in cool new features for the user, so it is time to pass it on to
      the non-git audience. this includes:
      <ul>
        <li>most processing is now being done in a new color
        space (L a/L b/L). this results in nicer exposure/tonecurve/denoise/color correction results.</li>
        <li>the pixel pipeline is now free to change dimensions of the image, which
        makes a crop/rotate operation (and lensfun in the future) possible.</li>
        <li>the code is now organised as plugins (image operations and views such as lighttable and darkroom).</li>
        <li>the lighttable view can filter and sort by rating.</li>
        <li>color management using lcms.</li>
      </ul>

      <em>(2009-10-08)</em> darktable moved from svn to git. get it from
      <code>git://darktable.git.sf.net/gitroot/darktable/darktable</code>. the svn repository
      is still around, but i will probably remove it in the next couple of weeks.
      we also have <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/darktable/">nicer forums now</a>.

    	<img src="images/mailinglist.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>we now have a mailing list</h1>
      <em>(2009-08-19)</em> in the hope to start a small community and to avoid duplicate email traffic, i
      created this <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/darktable-devel">mailing list</a>. also
      note that there are the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=938786">forums</a>.

      <div class="text">
    	<img src="images/release_0.2.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>0.2 beta is out!</h1>
      <em>(2009-07-06)</em> there have been some major changes in the last months. first, the processing
      backend has been replaced completely, based on an interface which is able to use libgegl (but currently doesn't,
      until gegl is fast enough). all operations are encapsulated in run-time loaded plug-ins.
      raw reading is now based on libraw-0.8. the lighttable got a slightly different look, and more image
      operations have been implemented (e.g. luma/chroma denoising). <br/>
      this release is still marked <em>beta</em>, which should indicate that not all features are yet in
      (especially some lighttable related tasks such as filtering, sorting etc.), and not everything will
      work bug-free and stable yet.

      <em>(2010-10-26)</em> while waiting for 0.7, we have put up an
      <a href="darktable-usermanual-draft-20101022.pdf">early draft usermanual</a> for you, to push forward
      this great effort, get some feedback, and reveal some details to you.<br />

    	<img src="images/watt.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>released 0.6</h1>
      <em>(2010-08-28)</em> finally a new release.. it has been so long that i hardly remember
      all the changes. let's try to list the most important ones:
      <ul>
        <li>libraw 0.10.0-beta3</li>
        <li>tethered shooting mode</li>
        <li>import from camera via gphoto2</li>
        <li>new, improved plugins: vignetting, velvia, grain, denoise (via bilateral filter), color transfer, channel mixer ..</li>
        <li>crop/rotate: straighten tool, perspective correction, guide lines (ported from digikam)</li>
        <li>lots of new input color matrices and base curves</li>
        <li>openexr export</li>
        <li>database format changed, which greatly improves speed (and cuts down used disk memory)</li>
        <li>film strip view in darkroom mode for quick image switching</li>
        <li>cool alternative demosaicing algorithms (ported from rawtherapee): dcb, amaze, vcd, c/a autocorrection</li>
        <li>customizable preset system for all darkroom modules with auto application to matching images, selected by exif</li>
        <li>reworked export system to modularly support export to picasa webalbum, email, or disk in jpg, png, 8/16-tiff, pfm, exr, or 16-ppm.</li>
        <li>lots of performance enhancements (plugins denoise and local contrast are still slow)</li>
        <li>translations: de es fi fr gl nl ru sv</li>
      </ul>
      as always, the release comes with a warning: it will be outdated horribly in very short time (even now git master
      has some really cool new features over the release tarball..).
      thanks to all contributors, translators, and everyone on #darktable!

      how to profile your camera for darktable to get rich and precise color rendition out of your images

    	<img src="images/crowrock.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>0.3 beta released</h1>
      <em>(2009-10-23)</em> there have been some major internal changes in dt since 0.2, and
      some of them result in cool new features for the user, so it is time to pass it on to
      the non-git audience. this includes:
      <ul>
        <li>most processing is now being done in a new color
        space (L a/L b/L). this results in nicer exposure/tonecurve/denoise/color correction results.</li>
        <li>the pixel pipeline is now free to change dimensions of the image, which
        makes a crop/rotate operation (and lensfun in the future) possible.</li>
        <li>the code is now organised as plugins (image operations and views such as lighttable and darkroom).</li>
        <li>the lighttable view can filter and sort by rating.</li>
        <li>color management using lcms.</li>
      </ul>

      <em>(2009-10-08)</em> darktable moved from svn to git. get it from
      <code>git://darktable.git.sf.net/gitroot/darktable/darktable</code>. the svn repository
      is still around, but i will probably remove it in the next couple of weeks.
      we also have <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/darktable/">nicer forums now</a>.

      <em>(2009-08-19)</em> in the hope to start a small community and to avoid duplicate email traffic, i
      created this <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/darktable-devel">mailing list</a>. also
      note that there are the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=938786">forums</a>.

      <div class="text">
    	<img src="images/release_0.2.jpg" class="img" alt="dreggn" /><h1>0.2 beta is out!</h1>
      <em>(2009-07-06)</em> there have been some major changes in the last months. first, the processing
      backend has been replaced completely, based on an interface which is able to use libgegl (but currently doesn't,
      until gegl is fast enough). all operations are encapsulated in run-time loaded plug-ins.
      raw reading is now based on libraw-0.8. the lighttable got a slightly different look, and more image
      operations have been implemented (e.g. luma/chroma denoising). <br/>
      this release is still marked <em>beta</em>, which should indicate that not all features are yet in
      (especially some lighttable related tasks such as filtering, sorting etc.), and not everything will
      work bug-free and stable yet.

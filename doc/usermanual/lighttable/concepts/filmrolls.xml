		<para>The basic element for organizing images in darktable is called a filmroll - a kind of virtual folder. 
                Whenever you import images from disk, the images are organized in a filmroll whose name is derived from the
                name of the disk folder. Re-importing a disk folder will add any new images to the existing filmroll; images already
                present in the filmroll are not touched.
                </para>

                <para>It is important to note that importing images in darktable does not involve a 
                physical copy step. Importing a folder into darktable is therefore <emphasis>not</emphasis> a backup operation of that folder.

				<sect4><title>edit</title>
					<para>Styles are a collection of history stack items. After pressing edit you are prompted with a dialog in which you can deselect
                                              specific items. Check option "duplicate" if you want to create a new style instead of overwriting the existing
                                              one; you need to give a new style name in this case.
					</para>

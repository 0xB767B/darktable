				<sect4><title>target storage</title>
					<para>Where to store your selected images. Different back-ends are implemented; including "file on disk", a LaTeX book template and
                                              various webalbums. Depending on the selected target storage you will be asked to give additional information like filenames, account
                                              names and passwords.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>filename template</title>
					<para>You can define the filenames that darktable generates for export. Several pre-defined variables can be used as placeholders. Hover with
                                              your mouse over the input field for a list with all defined variables.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>output directory</title>
					<para>Pressing button <inlinegraphic fileref="&icon_directory;" scalefit="1" width="2%" align="center" /> will open a dialog to define the parent directory for export.
					</para>
				</sect4>

				<sect4><title>file format</title>
					<para>darktable knows various file formats to export to. For some of them you need to additionally define your desired bit depth. If you export to jpeg files you
                                              can additionally define an output quality. Higher values will leed to larger file sizes.
					</para>
				</sect4>

				<sect4><title>max size</title>
					<para>Set the maximum width and height of your output images in pixels. A value of "0" will export with full resolution. Darktable currently can only do down-scaling; the maximum
                                              output resolution is defined by the parent image.
					</para>
				</sect4>

				<sect4><title>intent</title>
					<para>This option lets you define the intent, i.e. the way darktable will deal with out-of-gamut colors. See module "input color profile" for a more detailed description of the
                                              available options. Select "image settings" if you want the settings in module "output color profile" of the individual images to take precedence.
					</para>
				</sect4>

				<sect4><title>profile</title>
					<para>This defines the output color profile. Select "image settings" if you want the settings in module "output color profile" of the individual images to take precedence.
					</para>
				</sect4>
				<sect4><title>export</title>
					<para>Pressing this button will start a background job that will export all selected images. A bar at the bottom of the left side panel will display progress. Whenever a file
                                              is successfully exported a notification message will pop up. You may press on the pop-up to make it disappear.

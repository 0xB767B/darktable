            <entry>The shadows and highlights module allows to adjust the tonal range of darker parts of an image (shadows) and lighter parts (highlights); it can bring back details in shadows and highlights by enhancing local contrast.</entry>

    <title>Usage</title>
    <sect5>
      <title>shadows</title>
      <para>This slider controls the effect on shadows; positive values will lighten up shadows while negative values will darken them.

      <title>highlights</title>
      <para>This slider controls the effect on highlights; negative values will darken highlights while positive values will lighten them up.</para>

      <title>soften with</title>
      <para>This combobox choses the underlying blurring filter, gaussian or bilateral. Try bilateral filter if you experience
            halos with gaussian blur.</para>
    </sect5>
    <sect5>
      <title>radius</title>
      <para>This slider controls the radius of the involved blurring filter. Higher values give softer transitions between shadows and highlights
            but might introduce halos. Lower values will reduce the size of halos but may lead to an artifical look. As said, bilateral
            filter is much less prone to halo artifacts.</para>

      <title>compress</title>
      <para>This slider controls how strong the effect extends to midtones; high values reduce the effect to the extreme shadows and highlights; 
            low values cause strong adjustments also to midtones. You normally only need to touch this parameter if you want to limit
            the effects to the extreme shadows and highlights; increase the value in this case. At 100% this module has no visible effect any
            longer as only absolute black and abolute white are affected.</para>

      <title>shadows color adjustment</title>
      <para>This slider controls the color saturation adjustment made to shadows; high values cause saturation enhancements on lightened shadows; 
            low values cause desaturation on lightened shadows. It is normally safe to leave this at its default of 100%. This gives a quite
            natural saturation boost on shadows - similar to the one you would also expect in nature if shadows would receive more light.</para>
    </sect5>
    <sect5>
      <title>highlights color adjustment</title>
      <para>This slider controls the color saturation adjustment made to highlights; high values cause saturation enhancements on darkened highlights;
            low values cause desaturation on darkened highlights. Often highlights do not contain enough color information to give convincing
            colors when darkened. You might need to play a bit with this parameter in order to find the best fitting value depending on
            your specific image; but be aware that sometimes results still might not be fully satisfying.</para>

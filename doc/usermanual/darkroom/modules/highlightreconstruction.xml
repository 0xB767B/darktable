						<entry>This module tries to reconstruct color information that is usually clipped 
            					because of the information being not complete in all channels.
						If you do nothing, your clipped areas are often toned to the not clipped channel.
						For example, if your green and blue channels are clipped, then your image will appear red in the clipped areas.

			<para>Choose the profile or color matrix to apply. Darktable offers many widespread matrices along with an enhanced matrix processed by darktable team in 
                              order to provide a look close to the manufacturer one. You can also supply your own input profiles and put them into $DARKTABLE/share/darktable/color/in or
                              $HOME/.config/darktable/color/in, where $DARKTABLE is darktables installation directory and $HOME is your home directory.

						<entry>This module is an equalizer based on edge-avoiding wavelets. It allows to smooth or enhance details by acting on luminance frequencies and multiplying them by a factor.

	<sect3><title>Usage</title>
		<para>Low frequencies are on the left, high frequencies on the right. The vertical scale represents a multiplying factor. By default, the user sees a straight line with factor equal to 1, meaning that 
			no frequency is changed.
		</para>
		<para>To sharpen, you can draw a line going up from the low frequencies to the high ones. On the contrary, if you want to attenuate, just draw a line going down.
			You can change the area of influence by mouse scrolling. Moreover you can act separately on the luminance or the chrominance values.

						<entry>This module is used to denoise high iso pictures.
							It is flagged as a slow module due to its high resources consumption.
							Depending of your hardware, this module can currently slow down darktable or even crash it.
							Quite counter-intuitively, the greater the values for sliders, the lesser resources.

	<sect4><title>Usage</title>
		<para>A bilateral filter is an edge-preserving noise reduction filter. The intensity values at each pixel in an image are replaced by a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels.
                      The weights - based on a Gaussian distribution - depend not only on Euclidean distance but also on the range differences (differences in color intensities). Bilateral denoise preserves sharp edges.
                      As denoising is resource hungry it slows down pixelpipe processing significantly; it makes sense to activate this module late in your workflow.

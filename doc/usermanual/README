Writing guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
There are some format rulings and you easily can following it by copy an already existing
docbook file such if you are going to write a new example use darkroom/examples/crossdeveloping.xml
as a template for your own example.

Do NOT change table layouts etc. we want the document consistent!

Each section should be tagged with status "draft" <sect2 status="draft">...</sect2>
when someone have reviewed your section you should change status to "final" to get
the section into final usermanual document and also the translators will get this text for
translations.



Building the usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------
To generate the usermanual you need the tools xsltproc,xml2po and fop this document will include
draft sections and is used fo reviewing...

make



Building the final usermanual
---------------------------------------------------------
Generating a final usermanual which would not include the sections with status "draft" this
is for producing a manual for ditribution...

make darktable-usermanual-final.pdf



Building final translated manual
--------------------------------------------------------
when building a translated manual the content would only include sections with status "final" 
and where status is not set. so with other words, no section with status "draft" will occur.

make sv



Translators
--------------------------------------------------------
To add you language just simple edit Makefile.am and po/Makefile.am for adding your language 
code to TRANSLATIONS variable.

To initialize the po file run 'po/make <language code>' to initialize a new <language code>.po file.

Update the translation by just running the command 'make po/<language code>'

0.4 lighttable release
- whitebalance to replace temperature
  - how to use presets from ufraw?
- togglebuttons in history: toggle up if entered.
- white balance by adjusting white point of color input profile.
- webpage: about image with lens, screenshot, photograph or so.
- 2x version in plugin: dt and plugin (=>params)
 - .dt file starts with plugin version
 - plugin refuses to load for newer dt version
- lensfun auto scale
- bug for clipped mip maps and low resolutions.
- color picker for tonecurve/color correction/monochrome?
- progress bars for coresponding widgets (export)?
- button toggle in history when new history is pushed.
- scroll to opened expander in darkroom mode.
- lighttable plugins:
  - copy style
  - select handling
- libraw options plugin-dev: reload raw image.
  - image.h struct
  - table in image lib
- plug-in-template (translatable)
- write .dt-tags file (stars, keywords, ..?)
- progress bars
- dt_dev_process_to_mip: check hash
- dt_image_expose: check history cached in flags
- lib: separator thickness
- install: remove schema installation.
- show which images have been modified in lighttable mode.
- histogram fill light mouse gesture
- preview blacklist modules
- exposure: highlight clipped parts
- exr import
- tonemapping widget?
- clipping event hooks: crop
- user preferences
  - default processing stack, if exif matches

bugs:
- img unlock => flicker in library mode? (due to mipf trigger?)
- can't create export folder=>crash
- check for deleted images when opening a film roll!
- import very slow (hdd lock with gui??) on nfs homes
- import starts 3 threads but seems to be mono-core?
- open_raw has img cleaned up before finished during dt_exit
- zoom to wrong image bug: resize window helps (???)
- glist instead of sql query in export (or else altering selection after pressing export will change the behavior)

cleanup:
- remove most iop/*.h 
- colorin: use color matrix?
- sequentially work on preview/full?
- libraw autoexposure etc off?
- ahd,wb,autoexp,color_matrix in dt (use document mode proc)
- keep stdout clean! (shut up exiv2 and jpg)
- add some user guide documentation.
- progress bars for image folder import and image export
- mip0 broken for very lo-res images.
- print GPLv3 notice on top of all files

- copy function in lib:
  - flags, tags
  - history stack
  - histogram :)
- write/re-import small xml file for images to backup sql
- translations (de, etc)
- man page
- small 1:1 preview for sharpen etc.
- write back images to db after cache drop!
- quality parameter for pixelpipe init callbacks in modules?
- if kicking out mip maps from db: need to re-generate history pipeline mipf->mip4!
- new strategy to add images: add empty dia (with icon and filename)
  ordered by filename. then launch jobs in bg to load images, priority
  by visibility in lib
- add/removable modules in module stack (replace fixed stack)
- try gegl raw-load and openraw-load nodes
- reduce db size by kicking out float/mip thumbnail images
- check libraw speed
- insert more gegl:operations and modules
- harden db format
- import image: create dummy entry with this filename, create imgid and cache entry.
  - then load image mip on demand, using image_get cache requests.
  - image_import: no dummy entries for mipmaps!
    imageio_preview_write: update/insert into

1.0 roadmap:
- better demosaicing
- edge-avoiding wavelets with easy preset sliders for bayesshrink denoise.
- remove sharpen/denoise in favour of wavelet ops.
- quickly template for dt plugins
- remove libraw in favour of native gegl loading?

bugs:
 - import while still importing crashes.
 - check mipmap decisions (seem very lo-res)
 - image_load_job should take img id and get it from cache himself!
   (this is a serious problem if not all images fit into cache)
 - import folder file chooser sometimes not sized appropriately

feature requests:
 - physically delete raw from disk (selected)
 - gphoto2 import (views/acquire)
 - step to next image in darkroom mode (precache:)
 - rescale during export (email etc)
 - bzip2 compressed content
 - offline media reference in db
 - image variants (different history etc, new image with same source)
 - pizza button.
 - import: interrupt, continue, watch dir (all more robust)
 - clustered image view by similar tag/flag
 - user orient rotation
 - linear/gamma from database for camera models.
 - spot removal brush
 - ufraw style highlight reconstruction
 - images of expensive cameras for webpage.
 - clean up db for mem optimizations: keep only image+history, re-import mips.
 - remove dead links in library automatically?
 - cache auf platte, echte bilder irgendwo auf dvd/platte extern/kamera chip etc
   - moeglicherweise ECHTE bilder (dias im schrank)
 - bilder sortieren, evtl manuell (mehrere kameras in einen film usw)
 - tags and some tag search facility (expander in lighttable mode)
 - bottom control panel with buttons for lib->dev->lib
 - libglade => gtkbuilder.

usability:
 - navigation: buttons for zoom levels
 - closeup in 3:1 5:1 or 2:1 ?
 - disable dev controls/make invisible in lib?
 - make directory loading interruptible
 - navigation widget for lib?
 - all functions mouse-accessible

cache:
 - user profile guided prefetching for full raw load!

build/packaging:
 - doxygen documentation

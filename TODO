- efficiency:

  - dt_dev_process_to_mip: check hash?
- scroll to opened expander in darkroom mode.

bugs:
- bug for clipped mip maps and low resolutions.
- develop left without mipf loaded => output_width messed up.
- open_raw has img cleaned up before finished during dt_exit
- zoom to wrong image bug: resize window helps (???)

cleanup:
- remove most iop/*.h 
- keep stdout clean! (shut up exiv2 and jpg)
- add some user guide documentation.
- progress bars for image folder import and image export
- print GPLv3 notice on top of all files

- copy function in lib:
  - flags, tags
  - histogram :)
- write/re-import small xml file for images to backup sql
- translations (de, etc)
- man page
- small 1:1 preview for sharpen etc.
- write back images to db after cache drop!
- quality parameter for pixelpipe init callbacks in modules?
- new strategy to add images: add empty dia (with icon and filename)
  ordered by filename. then launch jobs in bg to load images, priority
  by visibility in lib
- try gegl raw-load and openraw-load nodes
- reduce db size by kicking out float/mip thumbnail images
- import image: create dummy entry with this filename, create imgid and cache entry.
  - then load image mip on demand, using image_get cache requests.
  - image_import: no dummy entries for mipmaps!
    imageio_preview_write: update/insert into

bugs:
 - magick write exif not functional in imageio_export_8
 - configure.ac: MAXOPT does not appear to work as expected on newer procs.
   => use march=native, fuck the older gcc on macs.
 - mac port : window size < 0 (ctl init)
 - JPEG loading needs shrink + orientation
 - dev switch resolution AFTER setting gui stuff.
   control->width is updated in expose, and configure
   is called in dev_enter. (just before) :(
 - image_load_job should take img id and get it from cache himself!
   (this is a serious problem if not all images fit into cache)
 - strange G_OBJECT cast errors when loading pfm/exr/pdf?
 - import folder file chooser sometimes not sized appropriately
 - histogram updates in fixed pipeline come too early/uselessly?


feature requests:
 - use GEGL to replace dev cache and operation interface!
   (still need gui interface for plug-ins)
   - replace operation string by gegl:dreggn
   - sort all operations in one fixed pipeline (on/off)
   - dev display is gegl:pixbuf node
   - also lo-res float buffer version
   - remove clip and zoom by gegl:crop and gegl:scale (in this order)
 - flags: deleted, cool, uncool..
 - user orient rotation
 - tonemapping for hdr?
 - linear/gamma from database for camera models.
 - spot removal brush
 - ufraw style highlight reconstruction
 - images of expensive cameras for webpage.
 - blackpoint
 - gamma: no linear part for some cameras.
 - interpolation as user parameter?
 - set default parameters for all controls in dev mode while in lib mode?
 - clean up db for mem optimizations: keep only image+history, re-import mips.
 - remove dead links in library automatically?
 - GMM for color model using EM in opencv!
 - cache auf platte, echte bilder irgendwo auf dvd/platte extern/kamera chip etc
   - moeglicherweise ECHTE bilder (dias im schrank)
 - bilder sortieren, evtl manuell (mehrere kameras in einen film usw)
 - zoom in in 3 steps?
 - hide gui triangles andere form und switch in/out
 - inotify dir watching
 - execute iop: pass global image window!
 - zoom in dev mode via mouse wheel/click
 - brightness/exposure highlight histogram stuff (fill blacks)
 - LensFun

priority list:
 - aoe, keys to change +-= table_cols/1 resp.
 - top gui with sql statements for lighttable mode ? for dev mode
 - exif tab: exif_table expose event: fill mouse_over_id exif data!
 - tags and some tag search facility (expander in lighttable mode)
 - clean up dev events: add history-> cache up -> fixed pipeline up
 - modular one-file plugin support:
   src/imageio/saturation.{c,h}:
   - dr_gui_XX_reset -> reset op to neutral/default params
     dr_gui_XX_init  -> init gui elements and callbacks
     dr_iop_XX       -> transform buffers
   - add expander to right vbox,
     init gui with expander->child
     expose: if op !=, gui_reset
     reserve imageop, need string hash?
 - image properties when zoomed in a lot
 - clean up namings/modules.
   - move expose to ctl or gui?
   - split ctl and sched?
 - bottom control panel with buttons for lib->dev->lib

image ops (GEGL):
 - white balance
 - exposure
 - luma/chroma denoising
 - crop

usability:
 - write out image_t at quit (exif, filenames, selected flags)
 - navigation: buttons for zoom levels
 - closeup in 3:1 5:1 or 2:1 ?
 - disable dev controls/make invisible in lib?
 - make directory loading interruptible
 - adjust navigation preview in dev on the fly?
 - image loading: load thumbnails first, if any.
 - navigation widget for lib?
 - curve widget presets
   - x-axis adjusters
 - active live histogram (exposure etc)
 - all functions mouse-accessible
 - library graph with keyword edges.
 - expander with exif data (+filename of saved image)

look:
 - dev img border
 - shadow border between center and outer panels
 - end markers :)
 - dev full res image possibly smaller as lo-res (paint border with bg)

cleanup:
 - QWERTZ/dvorak keyboard shortcuts run-time switching

cache:
 - user profile guided prefetching for full raw load!
 - load cache from disk only if md5sum matches

build/packaging:
 - doxygen documentation

  TIFFSetField(out, TIFFTAG_ZIPQUALITY, 9);
  TIFFSetField(out, TIFFTAG_PREDICTOR, 2);
- progress bars for coresponding widgets (export)?
- efficiency:
  - dt_image_expose: check history cached in flags?
  - dt_dev_process_to_mip: check hash?

bugs:
- develop left without mipf loaded => output_width messed up.
- open_raw has img cleaned up before finished during dt_exit
- zoom to wrong image bug: resize window helps (???)

cleanup:
- remove most iop/*.h 
- keep stdout clean! (shut up exiv2 and jpg)
- add some user guide documentation.

- print GPLv3 notice on top of all files

  - flags, tags
  - histogram :)
- man page
- write back images to db after cache drop!
- quality parameter for pixelpipe init callbacks in modules?
- try gegl raw-load and openraw-load nodes

1.0 roadmap:
- better demosaicing
- quickly template for dt plugins (translatable)

bugs:
 - import while still importing crashes.

feature requests:
 - gphoto2 import (views/acquire)
 - step to next image in darkroom mode (precache:)
 - bzip2 compressed content
 - offline media reference in db
 - clustered image view by similar tag/flag
 - user orient rotation
 - linear/gamma from database for camera models.
 - spot removal brush
 - images of expensive cameras for webpage.
 - libglade => gtkbuilder.

usability:
 - closeup in 3:1 5:1 or 2:1 ?
 - navigation widget for lib?

cache:
 - user profile guided prefetching for full raw load!

build/packaging:
 - doxygen documentation

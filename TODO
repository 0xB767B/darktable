CLAHE:
  halos around edges normal?

webpage updates:
- freebsd has dt (has had for a while :)
- list of supported cameras and reverse-engineered basecurves etc

0.6 release:
big new features:
- tethered shooting
- print mode?

- more transparent custom default/presets handling:
  - color in: input matrices as such defaults
  - white balance out of this system as well?
    show-only-for ticked for these, keep current sys in parallel

- fine-grained history stack copying/replacing: 
  - copy history stack augmented by list of favorite image styles
  - simple interface to [de-]activate single operations, or
    replace them with presets from the list instead.

- prefetching while browsing lighttable mode
- cleanup at end: make incremental during runtime!
- option to disable preview processing: never,always,only unaltered
- color labels: sort and import is weird.
- color labels: colored buttons in a row, more colors, more slots
- stars: possibility to filter by exact number, not >=
- rotate crashes (how exactly?)
- default portrait/landscape aspect to match image
- filmstrip h/v/match/off
- histogram not updated on cache warm lookups?? (=>histogram in cache)
- check sqlite3 disk speed (remove image: leave mip maps?)
- ctrl-a broken for sort by color label 
- whitebalance temp out: 5K, color input uses 6004 ?
- import from dt/dttags: detect duplicated images
- backup tables: presets, color labels
- gtkaboutdialog
- gtkentrycompletion for tagging and collect
- clean-up-gui mode for darkroom: collapse all and hide unused ops
  when entering darkroom mode
- image flag: history changed but not exported
  - select by this flag

- disable for ldr input: exposure,wb,basecurve,highlights
  - make exposure work with ldr, too.

- annoying coarse pixels when we have to wait anyways, and no moving took place.
- mipf not loaded on time in develop for small displays.

- ctrl-z ctrl-shift-z up/down in history stack
- metadata imgfilename etc with ellipzized file names
- read additional tags from exif?
- mouse wheel zoom in navigation
- splines: linear interpolation check box
- auto select image if there is only one on the light table
- decapitalize icc profile names
- lock zoom/pan checkbox in darkroom mode
- sliders for C/A in lensfun
- lensfun + crop: preview/full image differ in zoom/pan?
- built-in XYZ and linear color profile support?
- embed custom exif data in export plugin
- remember visible image/center image for each film and mode
- thumbnail regeneration trigger: expose after image loaded not enough?
- give tag for each film roll during import, make editing easy after
- compare sha1sum in db with image on open.
- whitebalance finetune presets: interpolate if not all in wb_presets.c
- develop bottom panel: color picker:
  - also pick output profile and zone
  - remove before label etc
- gimp code: optimized jpeg + gui for export
- embedded profiles?
- save custom defaults (sqlite table iop_defaults) to external file as well
- export override for output path (collection)
- leave corners free (top/bottom scrolling indicators)
- export/select by edited/up-to-date exported
- if dir is not found, try known top-levels or ask for new
- darkroom mode plugin template
- gnome-color-manager dbus interaction
- hdr tonemapping (reinhard 02)
- automatic re-import in raw import on button press?
- auto center/filter to 1 star/filename if new film is loaded
  - or: presets for every film in separate db.
- histogram fill light mouse gesture
- exposure: highlight clipped parts
- user preferences
  - gconf option for maximum number of jobs?
  - gconf performance presets (memory/preview subsample)
- scroll to opened expander in darkroom mode.
- views/browse.c: browse by similar tag:
  inner 1:1 lighttable image, border with smaller images with
  related tags, 2*k+2 many.
- browse clusters of images by
  - extract image statistics/compare metric
  - faces (opencv), hist L, hist wtf, hist (a,b)
  - select (random?) representative
- lighttable side-by-side mode
- embedded thumbnail as static snapshot
- try gegl 0.1.2
- mac bitch: gegl.h and Carbon.h are not friends.
- closeup in 3:1 5:1 or 2:1 ?
- user profile guided prefetching for full raw load!

bugs:
- develop left without mipf loaded => output_width messed up.
- open_raw has img cleaned up before finished during dt_exit

cleanup:
- keep stdout clean! (shut up exiv2 and jpg)
- add some user guide documentation.
- remove all rc = clang errors?
- check all g_list_delete_link 
- remove last few non-gconf settings.
- remove gtk_drawing_area_size()


- copy function in lib:
  - flags, tags
  - histogram :)

1.0 roadmap:
- better demosaicing
- quickly template for dt plugins (translatable)

feature requests:
 - bzip2 compressed content
 - offline media reference in db
 - user orient rotation
 - spot removal brush
 - libglade => gtkbuilder.
